# SBA-308
I had the getLearnerData function calculate each learner's weighted average score based on completed assignments, applying a 10% penalty if a submission is late. After checking that assignments belong to the course, it calculates scores as percentages, ignoring any assignments not yet due. For each learner, the function records individual assignment scores and an overall average, then returns an array with each learner's ID, average score, and assignment percentages. Definitely was a tougher assignment and will need to study more on JavaScript fundimentals but I'm eager to research more and improve.
